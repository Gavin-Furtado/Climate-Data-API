Finding relation between temperature and rainfall

Using the World Bank Climate Data API the monthly temperatures and rainfall of four countries from different continents namely, India, France, USA, Australia
were extracted and analysis was done on this data. The primary aim of this project was to investigate whether the rise in temperature leads to increase in rainfall,
however after data visualisation it was clear that there is no correlation between the two entities.

An interesting insight found during the project was that India and France had more increase in rainfall and negligible increase in temperature, 
this implies that there are more business opportunities for rainwater harvesting projects and great potential in the agriculture sector in these countries. 

Whereas in Australia and USA the increase in temperature higher than rainfall this could mean that over the years these countries might
have good a good market value for solar energy companies.
